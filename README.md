### Welcome!

I'm Benjamin Shultz and I'm an M.A. in International Relations and Master of Public Administration Dual-Degree Student at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University. I received a B.A. with Distinction in Political Science from Sonoma State University in 2019.

My research interests lie in all things relating to quantitative analysis in international relations, specifically relating to U.S. economic statecraft, the Great Power Competition, and comparative politics. I aim to further narrow this research interest in anticipation of completing a Ph.D. in the near future.
