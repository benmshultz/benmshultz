### Welcome!

I'm a Master of Public Administration Candidate at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University. I received a BA with Distinction in Political Science from Sonoma 
State University in 2019.

My research interests lie in all things relating to Federal politics, from past and current composition of the U.S. Congress, to reapportionment and gerrymandering, 
to the tension between states' rights and Federal power. I am fascinated by the American political system and seek to continue learning about it as a continue my
degree.
